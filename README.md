# SecureDevice

A simple library to detect device security.

To make project launch script
```
makeproject.sh
```

This will build the aar, and will be located in project main dir

```
${LOCAL_PATH}/securedevice.aar
```



**N.B: you must have a valid Gradle installation**

**Actually all project implementing the lib must have com.squareup.moshi:moshi-kotlin dependency**
